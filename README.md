## Data

Each example is a json with the following field:
* `model`: The source of long-form answer, one of [`Expert`, `GPT-4V`, `Gemini`, `LLaVA`, `QWEN`, `BLIP2`, `InstructBLIP`]. 
* `answerability`: The answerability label annotated by crowd workers from the original VizWiz dataset.
* `question`: The original question asked by blind and low vision individuals.
* `question_type`: The type of information asked in the question, one of [`Identification`, `Description`, `Reading`, `Others`]. Evenly distributed among question types.
* `answer_paragraph`: The answer paragraph.
* `answer_sentences`: The list of answer sentences, tokenized from the answer paragraph.
* `functional_roles`: The list of functional roles (1-3) for each sentence in `answer_sentences`. 
* `information_types`: The list of information types for each sentence in `answer_sentences`.
* `crowd_answers`: 10 short answers provided by crowd workers from the original VizWiz dataset.
* `crowd_majority`: Majority-voted answer among `crowd_answers`.

Here is an example of validity annotation:
